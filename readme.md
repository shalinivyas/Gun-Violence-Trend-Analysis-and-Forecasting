Gun Violence Prediction using R - Time Series Analysis 

This project will using the data from Kaggle for Gun Violence in Miami Dade County.Miami-Dade County (MDC) has a long-standing history of firearm violence, with firearm related injury accounting for 11.6% of admissions at a Level I Trauma Center (unpublished data). 

The purpose of this study is to investigate the best model to predict crime rate due to gun violence in the Miami Dade county, using the Box-Jenkins methodology. Applying annual data from Gun violence Archive from 2013 to 2018, resulted in the ARIMA (0,0,0) 
model with static forecasting being the most appropriate to predict the crime rate due to gun violence. Model estimation was achieved by the maximum likelihood-ML method and finally, the accuracy of the forecast was assessed based on certain criteria such as the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).
